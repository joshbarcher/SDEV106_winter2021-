			<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs
				in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a
				paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
				coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
				defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit.”
