			<p>Euler is held to be one of the <strong>greatest mathematicians</strong> in history and the greatest of the
				18th century. A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler's influence
				on mathematics: <q>Read Euler, read Euler, <em>he is the master of us all.</em></q></p>

			<p>Euler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter π (lowercase pi) to denote Archimedes'
				constant (the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter), as well as first employing
				the term f(x) to describe a function's y-axis, the letter i to express the imaginary unit
				<code>i = √−1</code>, and the Greek letter Σ (capital sigma) to express summations.
				He gave the current definition of the constant e, the base of the natural logarithm,
				now known as Euler's number.</p>
